# ------------------------------------------

# Before you start:
# 
# - Try not to read ahead.
# - Do one task at a time. The trick is to learn to work incrementally.
# - Make sure you only test for correct inputs. there is no need to test for invalid inputs for this kata
 
# String Calculator:

# 1) Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)
#    1. The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2”
#    2. Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers
#    3. Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
#    4. Remember to refactor after each passing test
# 2) Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
# 3) Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
#    1. the following input is ok:  “1\n2,3”  (will equal 6)
#    2. the following input is NOT ok:  “1,\n” (not need to prove it - just clarifying)
# 4) Support different delimiters
#    1. to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this:   “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ .
#    2. the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported
# 5) Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not allowed” - and the negative that was passed.if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# stop here if you are a beginner. Continue if you can finish the steps so far in less than 30 minutes.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 6) Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001  = 2
# 7) Delimiters can be of any length with the following format:  “//[delimiter]\n” for example: “//[***]\n1***2***3” should return 6
# 8) Allow multiple delimiters like this:  “//[delim1][delim2]\n” for example “//[*][%]\n1*2%3” should return 6.
# 9) make sure you can also handle multiple delimiters with length longer than one char
