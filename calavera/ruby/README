String calculator Kata written in Ruby. It works on JRuby and Ruby 1.9.2.

Note:

Although it seems correct and clear this is probably one of the worse implementations ever. 
If we take a look in detail we'll see that the complexity of the algorithm is
O(4n). In theory this is equal to O(n) but iterate the array four times
rather than one is still a bad practice . We should avoid the use of `map` and `select`, 
and check the restrictions into the `inject` loop the get a real complexity of O(n).
