My work Enviroment: PHPUnit 3.5.6 with PHP 5.3 on Ubuntu 10.10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHPUnit should be installed using the PEAR Installer.

The PEAR channel (pear.phpunit.de) that is used to distribute PHPUnit
needs to be registered with the local PEAR environment. Furthermore, components
that PHPUnit depends upon are hosted on additional PEAR channels.

  pear channel-discover pear.phpunit.de
  pear channel-discover components.ez.no
  pear channel-discover pear.symfony-project.com

This has to be done only once. Now the PEAR Installer can be used to install
packages from the PHPUnit channel:

  pear install phpunit/PHPUnit

After the installation you can find the PHPUnit source files inside your local
PEAR directory; the path is usually /usr/lib/php/PHPUnit.
